					<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This is a website to host a set of tutorials for BEAST 2. A core aspect of the site is that it should be straightforward to add or edit tutorials and that anyone should be able to contribute. For this reason the tutorials, and the website, are hosted on GitHub. There will be an organization page containing the website and each tutorial is a different GitHub repository.  Although tutorials are ideally hosted as repositories on the website organization page, they can also be hosted anywhere on GitHub. The website simply acts as an aggregator for tutorials. (The structure of the website also makes it ideal to act as an aggregator of BEAST2 packages, I added a couple of packages as tutorials just as a proof of concept).</p>

<h2>Website style and layout</h2>

<p>The website is a fork of Trevor Bedford&#39;s lab website <a href="http://bedford.io">bedford.io</a>. I haven&#39;t changed much of the style so far.
A lot of the things are great and should be left alone, but some other things should probably be changed:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t like Trevor&#39;s navigation bar. It is overly complicated (it uses a lot of code to make a collapsible navbar that can&#39;t be collapsed). </li>
<li>The website needs a footer.</li>
<li>KaTeX is beautiful, but it does not support all of the LaTeX mathematics environments. If we run into problems we should switch to MathJax, which seems to work with everything (but isn&#39;t as beautiful). </li>
</ul>

<h2>Website architecture</h2>

<p>The website is built using Jekyll, which creates a static site. That means there are no databases etc. so the site is faster, simpler and more secure.  New pages can easily be added as markdown files with a yaml header (which minimizes the amount of html that needs to be typed). To parse the markdown files to html I am using redcarpet, simply because Trevor used it, but this could be changed to kramdown or pandoc. </p>

<p>Each tutorial is a separate GitHub repository. The reasons for this decision are given <a href="/news/Distributed-vs-Central/">here</a>. A ruby script clones each repository listed in the website&#39;s config file and extracts the <code>README.md</code> file from the repository as well as some metadata. (<strong>TODO:</strong> The script should also detect/compile/convert the LaTeX version of the tutorial). </p>

<p>The website itself is currently hosted on GitHub itself, using github-pages. This is free, but has some limitations, e.g. we can&#39;t use a webhook to automatically run the ruby script when a tutorial is updated, but need to do it manually. This means that someone needs to periodically update the website by recompiling and pushing to the repository, or else changes to tutorials will not be apparent on the website. If we host the site outside of GitHub this would be done automatically.</p>

					<p>Since the website is built in Jekyll it can display Markdown pages easily. This opens up the possibility to write tutorials directly in Markdown. Markdown is much more human-readable than LaTeX and flexible enough to still provide practically the same functionality. In addition Markdown can easily be converted to practically any end format.</p>

<p>The way the site is built at the moment it can aggregate tutorials written in both Markdown and in LaTeX. For tutorials written only in LaTeX the site will only display the contents of the <code>README.md</code> file, and not the tutorial itself (see the skyline tutorial). Tutorials written in Markdown will additionally display the tutorial on the website (see the introduction to BEAST2 tutorial). All tutorials will display links to the GitHub repository and PDFs in the sidebar.</p>

<h2>Conversion from LaTeX to Markdown</h2>

<p>This should be easy enough. Markdown is very easy to learn (see <a href="/news/Style/">here</a> for a style guide).
For the most part the tutorial text can be copied verbatim and only the LaTeX commands need to be changed (usually to something much shorter and easier to read). </p>

<h3>Some things that Markdown cannot do</h3>

<ul>
<li>Keep rolling counters on figures, tables etc. and have the number automatically inserted when referencing an image (but you can add in an anchor and reference figures, tables etc.). This may actually be possible to implement using javascript or by adding a Jekyll extension. However, since tutorials tend not to be too complex it is probably easy enough to maintain a manual counter (as I have done for the introduction to BEAST2 tutorial).</li>
<li>Some of the less frequently used mathematical expressions. But this is only because I&#39;m using KaTeX at the moment (Mathjax can do it, but is not pretty). </li>
</ul>

<h3>Some things Markdown can do but I have not implemented yet</h3>

<ul>
<li>Bibtex references, using <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar">Jekyll-Scholar</a>.</li>
<li>Attribute the original author of the tutorial in the header</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conversion from Markdown to LaTeX</h2>

<p>Markdown preprocessors by default can output the document in a variety of formats (usually html, pdf and tex). However, there is usually some more tweaking that needs to be done afterward (see <a href="http://peterlu.github.io/2014/08/03/markdown_latex_pdf.html">here</a>).</p>

<p>I think it should be easy enough to write a Python or Ruby script that converts the automatic tex output into a LaTeX document with the right styles and fixes things like figures. In this way future tutorials only need to be written in Markdown and can be (almost) automatically output in pdf. To make it easier to convert from Markdown to LaTeX I prefer using the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> html tag instead of the native Markdown figure tag <code>![]()</code>. This also allows rescaling and makes it easy to add a caption and a reference to the figure. </p>

					<p>Anyone can easily contribute a tutorial to the website either by cloning an existing tutorial repository. To make this easier we will also provide an empty tutorial repository.</p>

<h2>Cloning a repository or starting from scratch</h2>

<ol>
<li>Clone and rename an existing repository (or create a new repository)</li>
<li>Write the tutorial either in Markdown or LaTeX (or both)</li>
<li>Contact one of the website maintainers

<ul>
<li>If the tutorial conforms to the right style we will add it to <code>_config.yml</code> and recompile the website. The tutorial will now appear on the website. </li>
<li>If the tutorial does not conform to the right style the contributor either has to change it or give one of us developer access to the tutorial repository so we can fix it. Then it gets added as above.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the author wants to, he/she can transfer ownership of the tutorial to us, so that it is hosted on the organization page.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Fixing a bug in a tutorial</h2>

<ol>
<li>Fork the repository</li>
<li>Do a pull request</li>
<li>One of us evaluates and accepts/rejects the pull request.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tutorial style</h2>

<p>Tutorials <strong>must</strong> contain a <code>README.md</code> file in the root. This file does not have to contain anything, but could also contain the full tutorial in Markdown format. </p>

<p>If <code>README.md</code> is empty the tutorial should contain a <code>.tex</code>  or a <code>.pdf</code> file in the root. The <code>.tex</code> file should compile using <code>pdflatex</code>. </p>

<p>Directory structure should be as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">---------- data/
    |
    |----- xml/
    |
    |----- precooked-runs/
    |
    |----- scripts/
    |
    |----- figures/
    |
    |-- README.md
    |-- biblatex_macros.tex
    |-- preamble.tex

</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>data:</strong> Contains data files for use in BEAST (alignments etc.)</li>
<li><strong>xml:</strong> BEAST control files.</li>
<li><strong>precooked-runs:</strong> Log and tree files from a BEAST run.</li>
<li><strong>scripts:</strong> Any additional scripts needed for pre- or postprocessing.</li>
<li><strong>figures:</strong> Figures used in the tutorial document.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the moment the website simply detects PDF files in the root and displays those, as well as the <code>README.md</code> file. We should add a script to: </p>

<ol>
<li>Convert <code>README.md</code> to a <code>.tex</code> file.</li>
<li>Compile any <code>.tex</code> files in the root to PDFs. </li>
</ol>

<p>That would make it unnecessary to store the compiled PDFs in the tutorial repository. </p>

					<h2>Distributed</h2>

<p>Here are a number of arguments why I decided to go for hosting each tuturial in a separate GitHub repository:</p>

<h3>Modular structure</h3>

<p>A modular distributed structure where tutorials can be easily added and removed is easier to maintain and makes it easy to add/remove tutorials (a single line needs to be added to <code>_config.yml</code> and the update script rerun). </p>

<h3>Bloating</h3>

<p>The tutorials and the website should be separated from each other. The website source code does not contain any tutorial data except for a list of GitHub repositories. Besides from separating code (best practice) it also keeps the source repository from becoming bloated (since tutorials contain a lot of figures/data files).</p>

<p>On the other hand the production version of the website <strong>does</strong> contain all the tutorials. It is not important to keep this repository from becoming bloated. The production version is only a copy of the compiled website, which is not stored in the development repository and can easily be overwritten if it becomes too bloated (the history is not important here). In fact, it should not be a repository at all, but only is one because it is hosted on GitHub. (At the moment I have both the production and development versions of the site in the same repo, because this is only a demo and I wanted to see if it could be done). </p>

<h3>Assigning blame (and metadata)</h3>

<p>By having each tutorial in a repository owned by the creator, the creator of the tutorial remains responsible for it. This keeps whoever is in charge of the website from having to maintain all the tutorials. </p>

<p>It is also best practice to keep tutorials separate, preventing contributors from messing with tutorials they should not have access to.</p>

<p>In addition, it allows us to extract individual metadata for tutorials and display it on the website - last updated, latest commits, owner, contributors etc. </p>

<h2>Central</h2>

<p>Arguments for keeping all of the tutorials together in one repository (and counterarguments):</p>

<h3>Everything is easy to find</h3>

<p>One clone gives you all the tutorials. One fetch and merge gives you all updates. </p>

<h4>Counterargument</h4>

<p>There is already a script for cloning all the repositories. It should be possible to provide a clone/download option for all tutorials on the website. </p>

<p>Moreover, since the website automatically lists tutorials in the order they were last updated, along with the dates they were updated it&#39;s easy to see which tutorials have been added or changed.Simply looking at a GitHub repository for all tutorials means that you see each commit, not only which tutorials have been changed, which can be confusing (e.g. if someone made a 100 commits to only one tutorial, or cleaned up formatting on all tutorials). </p>

<h3>Share data and figures</h3>

<p>Having all tutorials in the same repository makes it possible to share resources between tutorials </p>

<h4>Counterargument</h4>

<p>While duplication is generally not a good idea, having one tutorial using resources of another makes it possible to break several tutorials by changing one file (tutorials are no longer self-contained units, but are all connected to each other). This makes it difficult for someone not familiar with all of the tutorials to modify a single tutorial (there is no easy way to list which tutorials use which files/figures).</p>

<h3>It&#39;s easier for anyone to contribute</h3>

<p>To contribute your own tutorial, simply fork the repository, add your tutorial or fix a bug and do a pull request. </p>

<h4>Counterargument</h4>

<p>Fixing bugs can still be done by a simple pull request, only on the repository of each individual tutorial. </p>

<p>I agree that a modular structure adds a greater activation energy for external contributors to add their own tutorial. However, I don&#39;t think the extra overhead is outrageous (see <a href="/news/Adding-a-new-tutorial/">here</a>). However I <strong>don&#39;t</strong> think a modular structure adds extra maintenance overhead. With a central structure every time a new tutorial is added <strong>all</strong> of the tutorials need to be checked and tested (of course no-one will do this, but it is possible that the contributor accidentally edited files belonging to another tutorial). With a modular structure the contributor <em>cannot</em> edit other tutorials or the website. This is far more secure and makes it easier for us to maintain. </p>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a style guide to help in formatting Markdown content for the site. This page is very similar to the style cheatsheet on Trevor Bedford&#39;s site.
In general, I&#39;ve tried to adhere to GitHub style, with the intention that anything that renders on GitHub will render here as well.  The following isn&#39;t meant to be exhaustive, just a reminder of what&#39;s possible with Markdown. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Headings</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang=""># Heading 1
## Heading 2

###### Heading 6
</code></pre></div>
<h1>Heading 1</h1>

<h2>Heading 2</h2>

<h3>Heading 3</h3>

<h4>Heading 4</h4>

<h5>Heading 5</h5>

<h6>Heading 6</h6>

<hr>

<h2>Text styling</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">Italicize text by surrounding it in *asterisks* or _underscores_.
Bold text by surrounding it with **double asterisks** or __double underscores__.
Combine with **_double asterisks plus underscores_**.
Strike-through text with ~~double tildes~~.
Superscript contiguous text with carrots like x^2y, surround with parentheses for more complex expressions like x^(2y + 3z).
</code></pre></div>
<p>Italicize text by surrounding it in <em>asterisks</em> or <em>underscores</em>.</p>

<p>Bold text by surrounding it with <strong>double asterisks</strong> or <strong>double underscores</strong>.</p>

<p>Strike-through text with <del>double tildes</del>.</p>

<p>Superscript contiguous text with carrots like x<sup>2y,</sup> surround with parentheses for more complex expressions like x<sup>2y + 3z</sup>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Lists</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">* Thing one with an asterisk

<hr>

<h2>Links</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">[This is an external link to Google](http://www.google.com/)
[This is a relative link to elsewhere in the site](/projects/)
</code></pre></div>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/">This is an external link to Google</a></p>

<p><a href="/tutorials/">This is a relative link to elsewhere in the site</a></p>

<hr>

<h2>Images</h2>

<p>Images work like links, but with a prefaced !.  This supports SVG as well PNG, JPG, etc...</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">![](http://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png)
![An image with alt text](http://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg)
</code></pre></div>
<p><img src="http://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="http://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg" alt="An image with alt text"></p>

<hr>

<p>Can always drop in HTML, so sizing adjustments can be done with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">&lt;img style="width:50px;" src="/images/logo_bw.svg"/&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p><img style="width:50px;" src="/images/logo_bw.svg"/></p>

<p>To add a caption to an image use the figure tag, like so: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;figure&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"/images/logo_bw.svg"</span> <span class="na">alt=</span><span class="s">""</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"beastie"</span><span class="nt">/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;figcaption&gt;</span>A rat in a cage.<span class="nt">&lt;/figcaption&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/figure&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/logo_bw.svg" alt="">
  <figcaption>A rat in a cage.</figcaption>
  <a id="fig:beastie"/></a>
</figure>

<p>The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag is optional, but allows us to insert a reference to the figure, like so: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">This [figure](#fig:beastie) shows a rat in a cage.
</code></pre></div>
<p>This <a href="#fig:beastie">figure</a> shows a rat in a cage.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Code</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">A bit of inline monospaced font can be made `by surrounding text with backticks`.
</code></pre></div>
<p>A bit of inline monospaced font can be made <code>by surrounding text with backticks</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Larger code blocks can be made by surrounding the block with three backticks <code>```</code>, and code can be highlighted by specifying language (most languages are supported) after the backticks, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }

}
```
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Horizontal rule</h2>

<p>Use more than three hyphens, asterisks or underscores. Using only three hyphens will still draw a line, but will cause interference with some of the site&#39;s scripts that parse yaml headers.</p>

<h2>Line breaks</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated by two newlines, so it will be a separate paragraph.

This line is also a separate paragraph, though...
Adding a single line break does not create a new paragraph.

For multiple line breaks use `&lt;br&gt;` tags:
